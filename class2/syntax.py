# The python intepreter knows when to move on by finding a newline character (\n)
# vscode adds highlights to make code easier to read

# A function is a block of resuable code that
# can change depending on the inputs provided
# print("Hello world!")

# Programming languages have a concept of code ownership
# Ownership is defined in Python by indenting code
# def sayHello():
#     print("Hello!!")
#     print("Hello again!")


# print("Out of the function!")

# A function has paretheses behind it that must be present
# sayHello()


# Programs execture from top to bottom
# If a function is called before it's defined the compiler
# will send back ("throw") an error
# sayGoodbye()


# def sayGoodbye():
#     print("Goodbye")
