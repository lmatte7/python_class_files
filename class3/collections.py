# Tuples are arrays that can't be modified 
categories = ("Sci Fi", "Thriller", "Romance", "Non-fiction")

# Lists are arrays
a = [4,6,2,8,9]

# Access arrays by using their index
print(a[0])
print(a[4])

# Arrays can be added to 
# a.append(10)

# print(a)

# Arrays can also have elements deleted
# a.pop(3)

# print(a)


# Arrays can be the most useful to collect data
# random_numbers = [1,5,4,87,23,45,39,72,25,47,12,96,70]
# even_numbers = []

# for number in random_numbers:
  # if number % 2 == 0:
    # even_numbers.append(number)

# print(even_numbers)

# Python has great built in tools to help with arrays
# random_numbers.sort()
# print(random_numbers)
# random_numbers.reverse()
# print(random_numbers)


# A Dictionary makes it easier to remember where values are stored
# in the collection
# scores = {"lucas": 70, "roscoe": 65, "pepper": 100}

# A dictionary can't have duplicate keys. This can be really useful!
# random_letters = "AAAAABBBBAABBBAABBABABABBBBAAABBBBAAABBBABBABBABBABBAAAAABBAAAABBAAABBBAABAB"
# number_of_letters = dict.fromkeys(random_letters)

# for letter in random_letters:
  # if number_of_letters[letter] == None:
    # number_of_letters[letter] = 1
  # else:
    # number_of_letters[letter] += 1


# print(number_of_letters)
